# umBRELA

## üìü Instructions

### Create Conda Environment

```bash
conda create -n umbrela python=3.10
conda activate umbrela
```

```

### Install following dependencies for retrieval:
```bash
conda install -c pytorch faiss-cpu pytorch -y
```

### Install Dependencies

### Judgment generation snippet

#### Setting up the model jugde:
```python
from umbrela.vicuna_judge import VicunaJudge

judge_vicuna = VicunaJudge("dl19-passage")
```

#### Passing qrel-passages for evaluations:
```python
input_dict = {
    "query": {"text": "how long is life cycle of flea", "qid": "264014"},
    "candidates": [
        {
            "doc": {
                "segment": "The life cycle of a flea can last anywhere from 20 days to an entire year. It depends on how long the flea remains in the dormant stage (eggs, larvae, pupa).
